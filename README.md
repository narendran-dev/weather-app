# Weather Application

## Overview

The Weather Application is a simple web application that allows users to search for weather information based on location names. Users can type a location name in the search bar, and the application will provide suggestions for locations. Upon selecting a location, the application fetches and displays the current weather information for that location.

## Features

- **Location Search**: Users can search for locations by typing in the search bar.
- **Autocomplete**: The search bar provides autocomplete suggestions for location names.
- **Weather Display**: The application displays real-time weather information for the selected location.
- **Debouncing**: API calls for location search and weather data are debounced to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Axios for API calls
